            <h3>Full Stack Developer!</h3>
            <p> My journey has been quite the ride, starting off in Milwaukee before diving headfirst into sports like football and track during my high school years. The thrill of competition led me to earn a dual-sport scholarship for track and field as well as football at the University of the Cumberlands. Despite starting my academic journey aiming for healthcare, initially pursuing nursing and rehabilitation nutritionist roles at Florida State University, my heart was always drawn to technology. Computer programming fascinated me, and it felt like second nature. This passion led me to pivot and pursue a B.A.S. in Computing Technology and Software Development at Valencia College. My path has been a series of twists and turns, but it's shown me that my true calling lies in the world of technology. </p>

                            <p>My time at FSU began with a fervent pursuit in Child Sciences, specializing in nursing, reflecting my early aspirations to make a difference in healthcare. As I weathered these academic transitions, FSU became more than an institution—it became a crucible where I discovered the depths of perseverance, strength, and fortitude within myself.
